## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, learners should be able to:
- Explain the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy (FHS) and identify core directories by role.
- Navigate, create, copy, move, and remove files and directories safely.
- Inspect logs and file content efficiently using terminal-native tools.
- Apply Linux user/group/permission logic using practical octal values.
- Perform routine maintenance: disk checks, software updates, process checks, and connectivity tests.
- Use terminal productivity features and basic scheduling with `crontab`.

## Pre-Class Checklist
- Confirm Ubuntu shell access (local VM, cloud VPS, or Docker container).
- Ensure learners can run commands with `sudo` privileges in the lab environment.
- Prepare a practice folder (example: `/opt/ebright-lab/module2`).
- Verify network tools are installed (`iproute2`, `net-tools`, `dnsutils`, `curl`, `wget`).

## 1. The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy (FHS)

Understanding the Linux directory structure is the first step toward server mastery. Unlike the drive-letter system in Windows (`C:`, `D:`), Linux organizes everything into a single, logical tree from the root (`/`). Knowing where system configurations, logs, and user data reside is essential for quick troubleshooting.

### 1.1 Core System Directories
These directories contain the essential files required for the operating system to boot and function. Modifying files here usually requires administrative (`sudo`) privileges.

- `/bin` and `/sbin`: Essential binaries (commands) needed for the system to run.
- `/etc`: The configuration center. Contains system-wide settings (Nginx, SSH, users).
- `/boot`: Files needed to start the operating system.
- `/root`: The home directory for the superuser (`root`) account.

### 1.2 Operational and Data Directories
These locations are where the daily life of the server happens, housing website files, staff documents, and temporary system data.

- `/var/log`: The witness. Contains system and application logs.
- `/var/www`: The showroom. Standard location for web files (example: Parent Portal).
- `/home`: The residence. Personal folders for staff (example: `/home/sarah_tutor`).
- `/opt`: The guest room. Optional software or custom Ebright repositories.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files, often cleared during reboot cycles.

### 1.3 Quick Mapping Exercise (5 min)
Ask learners to run:

```bash
ls -ld / /etc /var/log /var/www /home /opt /tmp
```

Discussion points:
- Which locations are user data vs system configuration?
- Which paths should be changed carefully and why?

## 2. Help, Documentation and System Information

In Linux, you are never truly lost. The system is designed to be self-documenting, with built-in manuals and status commands that explain tools and environment details without requiring internet access.

### 2.1 Documentation Tools
When you encounter an unfamiliar command or option, these tools provide immediate guidance.

- `man [command]`: Full manual with detailed flags and behavior.
- `[command] --help`: Quick-reference usage summary.
- `whatis [command]`: One-line description of a command.
- `info [command]`: Hyperlinked documentation alternative to `man`.

### 2.2 System and Identity Information
Before making changes, identify your environment and account context.

- `uname -a`: Kernel version and architecture.
- `lsb_release -a`: Ubuntu distribution version details.
- `hostname`: Current server name.
- `whoami`: Current logged-in user.

### 2.3 Instructor Demo (5-10 min)

```bash
uname -a
lsb_release -a
hostname
whoami
```

## 3. Filesystem Operations: The Navigator's Kit

Navigating a server through text requires a mental map of directory relationships. These commands are your movement and construction toolkit in the terminal.

### 3.1 Navigation Commands
Movement in Linux relies on understanding your current location (working directory) relative to the rest of the tree.

- `pwd`: Print current working directory.
- `cd [path]`: Change directory.
- `cd ..`: Move to parent directory.
- `cd ~`: Jump to your home directory.
- `cd -`: Return to previous directory.

### 3.2 Creation and Manipulation
Building the Ebright folder structure requires consistent use of file and directory management commands.

- `mkdir [name]`: Create a directory.
- `mkdir -p [path]`: Create nested paths in one step.
- `touch [file]`: Create an empty file or update timestamp.
- `cp [src] [dest]`: Copy a file.
- `cp -r [src_dir] [dest_dir]`: Copy a directory recursively.
- `mv [src] [dest]`: Move or rename files/directories.

### 3.3 Deletion and Cleanup
CLI deletions are permanent. There is no recycle bin by default.

- `rm [file]`: Remove a file.
- `rmdir [dir]`: Remove an empty directory.
- `rm -r [dir]`: Remove a directory and contents recursively.
- `rm -rf [dir]`: Force recursive delete with no prompts. Use with extreme caution.

### 3.4 Guided Practice (10-15 min)

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/ebright-lab/module2/{finance,hr,academic}
touch /opt/ebright-lab/module2/finance/budget-2026.txt
cp /opt/ebright-lab/module2/finance/budget-2026.txt /opt/ebright-lab/module2/hr/
mv /opt/ebright-lab/module2/hr/budget-2026.txt /opt/ebright-lab/module2/hr/payroll-draft.txt
ls -R /opt/ebright-lab/module2
```

## 4. Content Exploration, Editing and Archiving

Server operations often involve logs, configuration files, and command output. You need safe inspection habits plus reliable editing and packaging techniques.

### 4.1 Content Inspection
Before editing any file, inspect it first.

- `cat [file]`: Print full file content (best for short files).
- `less [file]`: Scrollable viewer (`q` to quit).
- `head [file]` and `tail [file]`: View beginning or end of file.
- `tail -f [file]`: Follow a log file in real time.
- `grep [text] [file]`: Search for matching text patterns.

### 4.2 Text Editing Tools
Headless servers require terminal-based editors.

- `nano`: Beginner-friendly editor with visible shortcuts (`Ctrl+O`, `Ctrl+X`).
- `vi` / `vim`: Professional standard editor.
- In `vim`: `i` enters insert mode, `Esc` returns to command mode, `:wq` saves and exits.

### 4.3 Archiving and Compression
Archiving bundles files for transport and backup; compression reduces storage usage.

- `tar -cvf [name].tar [files]`: Create archive bundle.
- `tar -xvf [name].tar`: Extract archive.
- `gzip [file]`: Compress file.
- `gunzip [file].gz`: Decompress file.

## 5. Security Logic: Users, Groups and Permissions

Linux is a multi-user operating system. Security follows least privilege: users only get access required for their role.

### 5.1 Identity Management
Admins must provision and revoke access as staffing changes.

- `useradd -m [user]`: Create user with home directory.
- `passwd [user]`: Set or change password.
- `userdel -r [user]`: Remove user and home files.
- `groupadd [group]`: Create group (example: `finance`).

### 5.2 Permission Logic (Octal)
Permissions are combinations of read (`4`), write (`2`), and execute (`1`).

- `7` (`4+2+1`) = full access.
- `5` (`4+0+1`) = read and execute.
- `chmod 770 [file_or_dir]` gives full access to owner and group, none to others.

### 5.3 Ownership Control
Each file has a user owner and group owner.

- `chown [user]:[group] [file]`: Change owner and group.
- `chgrp [group] [file]`: Change group only.

### 5.4 Granting Administrative (Sudo) Privileges
Use administrative access only for trusted staff.

- Ubuntu grants admin rights through the `sudo` group.
- `usermod -aG sudo [user]`: Add existing user to `sudo` group.
- `visudo`: Safest method to edit `/etc/sudoers`.

## 6. Terminal Productivity and Task Scheduling

Professional administrators move fast and automate repetitive work.

### 6.1 Command History and Recall
- `history`: Show numbered command history.
- `!!`: Re-run last command.
- `Ctrl + R`: Search command history interactively.

### 6.2 Efficiency Shortcuts
- `Tab`: Auto-complete commands and paths.
- `Ctrl + C`: Stop current process.
- `Ctrl + L`: Clear terminal screen.

### 6.3 Piping and Redirection
- `|`: Send output from one command to another.
- `>`: Write output to file (overwrite).
- `>>`: Append output to file.
- `tee`: Write output to screen and file simultaneously.

### 6.4 Automation with Crontab
- `crontab -e`: Edit scheduled jobs.
- Syntax: `min hour day month weekday command`.
- Example: `0 0 * * *` runs daily at midnight.

## 7. Storage, Time and Software Management

Servers require routine maintenance to remain healthy, accurate, and secure.

### 7.1 Storage and Disk Health
- `df -h`: Disk free space summary in human-readable format.
- `du -sh [dir]`: Total size of a specific directory.

### 7.2 System Time, Calendar and Uptime
- `date`: Show current system date/time.
- `cal`: Show current month calendar.
- `uptime`: Show runtime duration and load averages.
- `timedatectl`: Inspect or configure timezone (example: `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`).

### 7.3 Package Management (`apt`)
- `sudo apt update`: Refresh package metadata.
- `sudo apt install [pkg]`: Install software.
- `sudo apt upgrade`: Upgrade installed packages.
- `sudo apt remove [pkg]`: Remove installed software.

## 8. Process and Network Operations

This final section covers runtime visibility and connectivity checks that are critical during outages and incident response.

### 8.1 Process Management
- `top`: Live CPU/RAM process view.
- `ps aux`: Snapshot of running processes.
- `kill [PID]`: Stop process by process ID.

### 8.2 Networking and Connectivity
- `ip a`: Show interface and IP details.
- `ifconfig`: Legacy network interface tool.
- `ping [host]`: Basic reachability test.
- `nslookup [domain]`: DNS query lookup.
- `traceroute [host]`: Path analysis to destination.
- `netstat -tuln`: Open/listening network sockets.

### 8.3 Remote Access and Secure Transfer
- `ssh user@host`: Secure remote shell session.
- `scp [file] user@host:[path]`: Secure file copy.
- `wget [URL]`: Download from web.
- `curl -O [URL]`: Retrieve remote file via URL.

### 8.4 Power Operations
- `halt`: Stop CPU/system operations.
- `poweroff`: Shut down and power off.
- `reboot`: Restart system.
- `shutdown now`: Immediate shutdown.

## Mini Lab: Ebright Department Folder and Permission Setup
1. Create users and group structure (lab-safe names):

```bash
sudo groupadd ebright_staff
sudo useradd -m -G ebright_staff sarah_tutor
sudo useradd -m -G ebright_staff hafiz_admin
```

2. Create shared departmental directory and secure it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/ebright/shared
sudo chown root:ebright_staff /opt/ebright/shared
sudo chmod 770 /opt/ebright/shared
ls -ld /opt/ebright/shared
```

3. Validate access behavior:

```bash
id sarah_tutor
id hafiz_admin
```

Success criteria:
- Learners can explain why `770` was selected.
- Learners can identify user owner and group owner from `ls -l` output.
- Learners can verify group membership using `id`.

## Knowledge Check (Exit Ticket)
1. Which directory stores most system-wide configuration files?
2. What is the practical difference between `rm -r` and `rm -rf`?
3. Why is `tail -f` useful during troubleshooting?
4. What does permission `770` mean in plain language?
5. Which command safely grants admin rights to an existing user in Ubuntu?

## Module 2 Summary
