# Ebright Linux Crash Course

## Introduction
This document provides the official 1-day training timetable for the Ebright Linux Crash Course. It outlines the full session flow across both training pillars, including lecture blocks, practical labs, review activities, and instructor implementation notes.

## Course Overview
The Ebright Linux Crash Course is designed to equip the IT and Administration team with practical skills for independent cloud server management.

Full detailed overview: [Training Overview](Training%20Overview.md)

### Pillar 1: System Identity, Access & Administration
- Focus: Establishing infrastructure foundations and organizational hierarchy.
- Objective: Build a professional server mindset through CLI operations, VPS administration, SSH security, filesystem navigation, and role-based access controls for internal data protection.
- Coverage: Linux fundamentals, remote access, filesystem hierarchy, users and permissions, automation basics, and core process/network operations.

### Pillar 2: Deployment, Security & Continuity
- Focus: Application delivery, monitoring, and system stability.
- Objective: Transition from system administration to application operations, including deployment workflows, system diagnostics, firewall hardening, backup planning, and recovery readiness.
- Coverage: Snapshots, package management, Git-based deployment, DNS identity, UFW firewall setup, and continuity procedures.

## Learning Outcome
By the end of the day, the Ebright IT team transitions from passive managed-host users to active cloud infrastructure administrators with practical survival skills to keep services stable, secure, and accessible.

General objectives:
- Build confidence using Linux CLI commands for daily server administration tasks.
- Apply secure access and identity practices, including SSH key usage and role-based permissions.
- Perform structured filesystem and user/group management aligned with departmental operations.
- Execute basic deployment and update workflows using package management and Git.
- Monitor system health, interpret core diagnostics, and respond to common operational incidents.
- Implement continuity controls through snapshots, backups, firewall hardening, and recovery readiness.
