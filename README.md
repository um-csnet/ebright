## Asset

| Module | File Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module 1 | `asset/module1/Dockerfile` | Builds Ubuntu training image with SSH server and `trainee` user for remote access practice. |
| Module 1 | `asset/module1/docker-compose.yml` | Starts the SSH practice container and maps host port `2222` to container port `22`. |
| Module 3 | `asset/module3/docker-compose.yml` | Comprehensive stack for extra lab: Nginx reverse proxy, app (`whoami`), PostgreSQL, Redis, Adminer, and optional toolbox profile. |
| Module 3 | `asset/module3/nginx/default.conf` | Nginx reverse-proxy config with `/healthz` endpoint and upstream routing to app service. |
| Module 3 | `asset/module3/deploy/Dockerfile` | Sample Docker image build recipe used in Module 3 image-based deployment workflow. |
| Module 3 | `asset/module3/deploy/index.html` | Sample static page packaged into the Module 3 deployment image for verification. |

## First 2 Minutes Setup (VS Code)
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open terminal in VS Code: `Terminal > New Terminal`.
3. Clone and open the training repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/um-csnet/ebright.git
cd ebright
code .
```

4. In the opened project terminal, run:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Expected:
- Repository is cloned and opened in VS Code.
- Docker command returns a version string.
- Docker Compose command returns a version string.

### Pillar 1: System Identity, Access & Administration
- Focus: Establishing infrastructure foundations and organizational hierarchy.
- Objective: Build a professional server mindset through CLI operations, VPS administration, SSH security, filesystem navigation, and role-based access controls for internal data protection.
- Coverage: Linux fundamentals, remote access, filesystem hierarchy, users and permissions, automation basics, and core process/network operations.

### Pillar 2: Deployment, Security & Continuity
- Focus: Application delivery, monitoring, and system stability.
- Objective: Transition from system administration to application operations, including deployment workflows, system diagnostics, firewall hardening, backup planning, and recovery readiness.
- Coverage: Snapshots, package management, Git and Docker deployment workflows, DNS identity, UFW firewall setup, and continuity procedures.

## Learning Outcome
By the end of the day, the Ebright IT team transitions from passive managed-host users to active cloud infrastructure administrators with practical survival skills to keep services stable, secure, and accessible.

General objectives:
- Build confidence using Linux CLI commands for daily server administration tasks.
- Apply secure access and identity practices, including SSH key usage and role-based permissions.
- Perform structured filesystem and user/group management aligned with departmental operations.
- Execute basic deployment and update workflows using package management, Git, and Docker.
- Monitor system health, interpret core diagnostics, and respond to common operational incidents.
- Implement continuity controls through snapshots, backups, firewall hardening, and recovery readiness.
